Task Manager Project
This project is a Trello-like task management application designed to showcase my full‑stack development and DevOps skills. It demonstrates my ability to build a modern, scalable application using containerization, CI/CD pipelines, cloud hosting, flexible NoSQL databases, and secure authentication.

Overview
The Task Manager application allows users to create, update, and organize tasks using a board interface similar to Trello. Users can create boards, lists, and cards to manage their tasks efficiently. The project is built with a focus on modern development practices and cloud deployment strategies.

Key Features
Board & Task Management: Create, update, and delete boards, lists, and task cards.
Real-Time Interactions: A dynamic, responsive UI built with Next.js and React.
User Authentication: Secure user sign-up and sign-in using AWS Cognito.
Flexible Data Storage: Data stored in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging a NoSQL structure.
Containerized Deployment: Backend services are containerized with Docker and deployed on Amazon ECS (using EC2).
CI/CD Automation: GitHub Actions pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.
Cloud Hosting: Frontend is hosted on AWS Amplify with built-in CI/CD support.
Tech Stack
Frontend:

Next.js & React
Tailwind CSS (or your chosen CSS framework)

GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
Database:

MongoDB Atlas (Free Tier available) for NoSQL data storage
Authentication:

AWS Cognito for secure user authentication (Free Tier available)
DevOps & CI/CD:

Docker for containerization
GitHub Actions for build, test, and deployment automation
Amazon ECS on EC2 for hosting backend services

Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
Docker (for containerizing the backend)
Git
An AWS account with access to Amplify, ECS, and Cognito
A MongoDB Atlas account (free tier available)
Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Configure environment variables (create a .env.local file) for API endpoints, Cognito Pool IDs, etc.
Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory (if using a separate backend):
bash
Copy code
cd backend
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Build your Docker image:
bash
Copy code
docker build -t task-manager-backend .
GitHub Actions & CI/CD
The repository includes GitHub Actions workflows to run tests, build Docker images, and deploy your application automatically.
Update the .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml file with your AWS credentials and configuration.
Running the Application Locally
Using Next.js (Frontend Only)
To run the Next.js application locally:
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.
Using Docker Compose (Full Stack)
If you have a docker-compose.yml set up, run:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose up
This will start both the frontend and backend containers locally.
Deployment
Frontend:
Deploy your Next.js project to AWS Amplify using its Git integration. Amplify will automatically build and deploy your application.

Backend:
Deploy your Dockerized backend to Amazon ECS on EC2. Configure your CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions to push the Docker image to Amazon ECR and update your ECS service.

Database & Authentication:
Use MongoDB Atlas (configure connection strings in your backend) and AWS Cognito for authentication.

What This Project Demonstrates
Full-Stack Development:
Building an application from front end to back end using modern frameworks (Next.js, React, Node.js) and best practices.

DevOps & CI/CD:
Containerization with Docker, automated builds, testing, and deployments using GitHub Actions, and deployment on Amazon ECS.

Cloud Integration:
Leveraging AWS services (Amplify, ECS, Cognito) and MongoDB Atlas to build scalable, production-ready applications.

UI/UX Design:
Creating a responsive, user-friendly Trello-like interface.

Future Enhancements
Real-Time Collaboration:
Implement WebSockets or AWS AppSync to allow real-time updates for board and task changes.

Advanced Authentication & Authorization:
Enhance user roles and permissions using AWS Cognito and custom logic.

Improved Error Handling & Monitoring:
Integrate logging and monitoring tools (like AWS CloudWatch) for improved observability.

Mobile Optimization:
Extend the application to be fully responsive on mobile devices, or even build a React Native companion app.
